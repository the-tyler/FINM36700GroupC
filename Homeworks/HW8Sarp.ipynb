    "# 1.1 - General Info of LTCM\n",
    "    -Securities Traded: LTCM exploited market mispricings and sought . To achieve that, they engaged in convergence and relative value trading strategies. They sold liquidity or in other words, they became the counterparty to financial institutions that had specific needs (French insurance companies or Japanese banks) - dislocation in financial markets. There is a wide range of securities they traded. Primarily, they traded government bond swaps spreads (exchanging fixed interest with variable interest or vice versa). Also, they traded fixed rate residential mortgages, volatility, relative value in yield curve and in equities.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -Trading Freq: The goal of LTCM was to make money in the long horizon. Especially for their convergence trades, they took long positions on one side and hedged that position with a short on the other side. Some of the trades liquidated as quickly as 6 months.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -Skewness of Trades: They targetted small gains from many trades using leverage to exploit arbitrage. However, they are susceptible to extreme market events\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -Forecasting: Their models found mispricing in the market and the principals of LTCM found the raionale of the mispricing. Specifically, they avoided outright long positions. The preference of trades were in majority little to no default ones. However, to exploit relative value strategy, for instance they included positions of long of a corporation's debt and short of its equity.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.2 - Advantage of LTCM\n",
    "    - Efficient Financing: Primary edge is in efficient funding and financing due to prop trading capabilities\n",
    "    - Fund Size: High AUM allowed LTCM to get favorable rates\n",
    "    - Collateralization: Less haircut paid\n",
    "    - Long Term committment of capital from investors\n",
    "    - Liquidity and Hedging (Finding liquidity and efficient financing to match while avoiding default risk)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.3 - Funding Risk\n",
    "    - Collateral haircut: During high stress events, collateral haircut goes up. Normally when LTCM purchases US Treasury bonds through repo agreeements which collateralized the bond itself, there is 1% haircut in the collateralized value of the bond. When there is a market disruptive event, the haircut increases to let's say 3%. Knowing that normally LTCM funds e.g. swap spread trades with collateral, when there is higher haircut, it needs to inject cash to execute the trade.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Repo maturity: Typically, repos are overnight instruments but it's possible to see repos with maturity ranging from 6 months to 1 year. LTCM entered in long-term repo contracts which is unusual. When there was credit risk, the same repos were not available to LTCM.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Equity redemption: In convergence trade, it's possible to see dramatic divergence until the two securities diverge. This may result in a margin call and investor further financing to float the trade. This is an example of Equity redemption risk for LTCM.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Loan access: During high stress times, accessing to financing can be challenging. LTCM managed to secure an unsecured loan from a syndicate of banks without a material adverse change clause (This clause makes funding available to LTCM even if they do not perform well)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.4 - Quantify and Manage Liquidity Risk\n",
    "    - The liquidity risk does not seem like a problem for LTCM because their portfolios are self-financing. In other words, a self-financing portfolio does not need cash injection or withdrawal to/from the portfolio. Also, LTCM and its counterparties collateralized their obligations in a two way mark-to-market process which ensures liquidity. Furthermore, by stress-testing LTCM estimated the theoretical worst-case haircuts. Thanks to these, LTCM managed to structure its financing and didn't need to liquidate its position because of adverse market move. LTCM quantified its liquidity risk by adjusting security correlation. They assumed positive correlation across all asset classes in the short-term. \n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.5 - Monitor Leverage \n",
    "    - LTCM did not monitor its leverage ratio explicitly given the lack of major high stress event in the market. However, they considered returning some/all investors funds back to delever. Another thing is rven though their notional amount of contract looked very high, rather than ending a contract (which is usually costly), they hedged their risk with a new contract. This pushed LTCM's total notional amount higher but did not make them necessarily highly levered.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.6 - Convergence Trade & Relative Value Trade\n",
    "    - Relative value trade is basically taking a relative bet against two securities rather than an absolute bet in one or both. An example from the case is stocks of Shell and Royal Dutch Petroleum. Because the merger will 100% go through, Royal Dutch Petroleum's stock price is expected to converge to Shell's stock price ultimately since they would become the same company after merger. This is the Convergence Trade part of the Relative Trade strategy. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Shell was trading in discount at Royal Dutch, LTCM longed Shell and shorted Royal Dutch. This exposes LTCM only to the differential value risk between these two stocks. And because there is no directional bet, there is no need for hedging (Relative value trade is already immune to directional changes as long as the two securities move in the same direction)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Another example of the Convergence Trade can be from fixed income securities. There are many different interest rates such as Fed Funds Rate and SOFR (Collateralized Overnight Funds Rate). Theoretically, these are risk-free rates and they represent the same rate. However, they are not always the same in the market. If Feds Fund Rate is lower than SOFR, one can borrow from FED and long SOFR. Once the rates converge, arbitrage gives out the profit (Type II arbitrage)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Another example of the Convergence Trade is with futures and their underlyings. If one thinks that futures contract price is overvalued relative to the expected future price of the spot of the underlying, he can long the underlying and short the future contract. When future contract expires, the underlying and the future contract would have the same price.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - One year after the case, LTCM lost most of its value due to non-converging trades it had. Convergence risk is tremendous. Note that even though ultimately these securities converge and LTCM proves itself right, securities stayed divergent for a long time and caused LTCM to blow up due to illiquidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Notes on Covered Interest Parity (CIP) and Uncovered Interest Parity (UIP)\n",
    "    - CIP: Covered Interest Rate Parity is a no-arbitrage relation that says the best future spot FX rate predictor is the current forward FX rate. The formula for CIP uses the forward rates and the interes rates of the base and the foreign currency to check if there is an arbitrage opportunity. However, in absence of arbitrage CIP must hold true.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - UIP: Uncovered Interest Parity is a theory, I repeat it's a theory and therefore we can see it as a model. Unlike CIP, UIP uses the expected spot rates for the future. Ideally, the regression model(X = interest rate differential of the base and the foreign currency, y = growth in the USD against the foreign currency) should output Beta = 1 and Alpha = 0. This means that for each unit of increase in the interest rate of the foreign currency, base currency (USD) appreciates 1 unit with Alpha = 0. This boils down to no arbitrage opportunity for investor. Below, we see Beta is very close to 0 and sometimes negative or greater than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note that if expected spot rates for the future and the forward rates are equal, than CIP and UIP point out the same equation."
